# MergedCash | Local Christian Currency
## Cash that never leaves your geographic community

Our vision is to give God everything, undo poverty, and prevent slavery first in South Africa, then Africa, and to the ends of the earth.
Apart from coding the software, we are actively educating and building the needed relationships to help its adoption in African communities.

MergedCash is a unique local private-currency app that anyone can use to facilitate a local or custom digital currency in places where money is more scarce than people and resources.

Please donate to support the work of HomelessCash so we can reach the poor and build the needed infrastructure and jobs required to accomplish our vision.

Thank you for your tireless generosity!
