# MergedCash - A Christian Community Currency App

### MergedCash is a unique regional private-currency app that anyone can use to facilitate a local or custom digital currency in places where money is more scarce than people and resources.

Our vision is to give God everything, undo poverty, and prevent slavery first in South Africa, then Africa, and to the ends of the earth.

Apart from being an App, MergedCash is also a model that can help make currencies:
- Transparent
- Reduce crime
- Never leave a neighbourhood
- Immune to inflation
- Exclude the disadvantages of cryptocurrency
- Not compete with taxes and similar obligations
- Protect your data and property by default
- Intrinsically favor neighbourly love
- Support the resourcefulness of national economies and the safety from external forces
- Possess attributes that help the rehabilitation of the poor, the environment, and those held in slavery
- Regenerable by the persons, relationships, resourcefulness, and ethics of a neighborhood
- Adaptable to the economic needs and limits of their respective communities

Please donate to support the work of HomelessCash so we can reach the poor and build the needed infrastructure and jobs required to accomplish our vision.

Thank you for your tireless generosity!
